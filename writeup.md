MIT Virtual Source Model 2.0.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Mentor**:
  * Professor [Shaloo Rakheja](http://engineering.nyu.edu/people/shaloo-rakheja), Department of *Electrical and Computer Engineering*, *New York University*

**Project Description:**
  * The MVS 2.0.0 model is semi empirical model that incorporates the lowering of the virtual source (the peak of the energy band also known as top of barrier) charge due non-equilibrium transport.
  * Understood the charge model of MVS (MIT Virtual Source) model 2.0.0. The project required some background knowledge that was mostly covered by course on nanoHUB-U on nano-transistors and the rest was covered by other resources. 
  * Simulated the MATLAB code of both MVS 1.1 and MVS 2.0.0 models and the results were compared (of MVS 2.0.0) to real life data of InGaAs HEMT and ET-SOI devices (data already in the complete bundle).
  * Understood the results and tried to bind the physics involved with it.
  * Observed various device properties variation like capacitances, conductivity and charges at different junctions in the MOSFET on other semi empirical parameters.
  * Used online simulation tool [SCHRED](https://nanohub.org/resources/221) to understand this nanoscale even in better way. 
  
**Project Resources:**  
* [MVS Model 2.0.0](https://nanohub.org/publications/74/1)
* [Presentations]()

**Software/Libraries used:** MATLAB, SCHRED(nanoHUB online tool)

**Things Learned:**
  * Electrostatics involved in MOSFETS in the nanoscale regime
  * Variation of many known parameters in this scale which are often assumed constant
  * Usage of MATLAB in simulation and plotting graphs

Android Development
-------------------------------------------------------
**Mentor:** Professor [Manindra Agrawal](http://cse.iitk.ac.in/users/manindra/), Department of *Computer Science and Engineering*, *IIT Kanpur*

**Description of Tasks:**
  1. Implemented proguard to reduce the size of the application.
  2. Implemented ‘Crashlytics’, one of the kits in [Fabric](https://get.fabric.io/) tool, for crash reporting in the app.
  3. Tested the working of crashlytics by creating a small crash.
  4. Learned methods of restoring scroll position in app.
  5. Learned about robolectric for writing test cases.

**Skills:**
  * Understood the MVVM implementation which is implemented in the project.
  * Learned about application development by using android studio.
  * Learned distributed version control system ‘Git’.
